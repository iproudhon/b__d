            "description": "PROPOSE a command to run on behalf of the user.\nNote that the user may have to approve the command before it is executed.\nThe user may reject it if it is not to their liking, or may modify the command before approving it.  If they do change it, take those changes into account.\nIn using these tools, adhere to the following guidelines:\n1. Before starting servers or long-running processes, list the terminals folder to check if they are already running in existing terminals.\n2. Based on the contents of the conversation, you will be told if you are in the same shell as a previous step or a different shell.\n3. If in a new shell, you should `cd` to the appropriate directory and do necessary setup in addition to running the command. By default, the shell will initialize in the project root.\n4. If in the same shell, LOOK IN CHAT HISTORY for your current working directory. The environment also persists (e.g. exported env vars, venv/nvm activations).\n5. For ANY commands that would require user interaction, ASSUME THE USER IS NOT AVAILABLE TO INTERACT and PASS THE NON-INTERACTIVE FLAGS (e.g. --yes for npx).\n6. For commands that are long running/expected to run indefinitely until interruption, please run them in the background. To run jobs in the background, set `is_background` to true rather than changing the details of the command.\n\nBy default, your commands will run in a sandbox. The sandbox allows most writes to the workspace and reads to the rest of the filesystem. Network access, modifications to git state and modifications to ignored files are disallowed. Reads to git state are allowed. Some other syscalls are also disallowed like access to USB devices. Syscalls that attempt forbidden operations will fail and not all programs will surface these errors in a useful way.\nFiles that are ignored by .gitignore or .cursorignore are not accessible to the command. If you need to access a file that is ignored, you will need to request \"all\" permissions to disable sandboxing.\nThe required_permissions argument is used to request additional permissions. If you know you will need a permission, request it. Requesting permissions will slow down the command execution as it will ask the user for approval. Do not hesitate to request permissions if you are certain you need them.\nThe following permissions are supported:\n- network: Grants broad network access to run a server or contact the internet. Needed for package installs, API calls, hosting servers and fetching dependencies.\n- git_write: Allows write access to .git directories. Required if you want to make commits, checkout a branch or otherwise modify any git state. Not required for read-only commands like git status or git log.\n- all: Disables the sandbox entirely. If all is requested the command will not run in a sandbox and the sandbox cannot impact the result of the command.\nOnly request permissions when they are actually needed for the command to succeed. Most file operations, reading, and local builds work fine in the default sandbox.\nMake sure to request git_write permissions if you need to make changes to the git repository, including staging, unstaging or committing.\nIf you think a command failed due to sandbox restrictions, run the command again with the required_permissions argument to request what you need. Don't change the code, just request the permissions.",

This tool is faster and respects .gitignore/.cursorignore.\n- Supports full regex syntax, e.g. \"log.*Error\", \"function\\s+\\w+\". Ensure you escape special chars to get exact matches, e.g. \"functionCall\\(\"\n- Avoid overly broad glob patterns (e.g., '--glob *') as they bypass .gitignore rules and may be slow\n- Only use 'type' (or 'glob' for file types) when certain of the file type needed. Note: import paths may not match source file types (.js vs .ts)\n- Output modes: \"content\" shows matching lines (default), \"files_with_matches\" shows only file paths, \"count\" shows match counts per file\n- Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (e.g. use interface\\{\\} to find interface{} in Go code)\n- Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like struct \\{[\\s\\S]*?field, use multiline: true\n- Results are capped for responsiveness; truncated results show \"at least\" counts.\n- Content output follows ripgrep format: '-' for context lines, ':' for match lines, and all lines grouped by file.\n- Unsaved or out of workspace active editors are also searched and show \"(unsaved)\" or \"(out of workspace)\". Use absolute paths to read/edit these files.",

This helps track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness.\n\nNote: Other than when first creating todos, don't tell the user you're updating todos, just do it.\n\n### When to Use This Tool\n\nUse proactively for:\n1. Complex multi-step tasks (3+ distinct steps)\n2. Non-trivial tasks requiring careful planning\n3. User explicitly requests todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks (numbered/comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - capture requirements as todos (use merge=false to add new ones)\n6. After completing tasks - mark complete with merge=true and add follow-ups\n7. When starting new tasks - mark as in_progress (ideally only one at a time)\n\n### When NOT to Use\n\nSkip for:\n1. Single, straightforward tasks\n2. Trivial tasks with no organizational benefit\n3. Tasks completable in < 3 trivial steps\n4. Purely conversational/informational requests\n5. Todo items should NOT include operational actions done in service of higher-level tasks.\n\nNEVER INCLUDE THESE IN TODOS: linting; testing; searching or examining the codebase.\n\n### Examples\n\n<example>\n  User: Add dark mode toggle to settings\n  Assistant:\n    - *Creates todo list:*\n      1. Add state management [in_progress]\n      2. Implement styles\n      3. Create toggle component\n      4.
